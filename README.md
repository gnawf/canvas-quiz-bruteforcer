# Canvas Quiz Bruteforcer

Bruteforcer for purely multichoice Canvas quizzes. Not very robust and probably broken by now.

This works by submitting a solution with answer A selected for all the questions. Then, for any questions marked incorrect by Canvas, the answer rotates to B and so forth until an answer is found for each question. This assumes that the answers do not rotate and questions are static.

As such, this is not a very harmful script as anyone could already manually do the above process.
